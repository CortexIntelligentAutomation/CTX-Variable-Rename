# Variable Rename Module
The Cortex Variable Rename module focuses on the updating of variable names within a flow or subtask, both when the variables are declared in the variable store and when they are referred to in block properties. After performing the rename the flow or subtask should function in the exact same manner as it did beforehand.

For example, the module could be used by a flow author who wishes to update a flow with ambiguously or vaguely named variables to have names that may be more meaningful to another author. Another common use may be to follow Cortex Best Practices by adding a subtaskâ€™s acronym to the front of each variable it uses.
